  by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Their long 
  association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior leading to a large
  number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be 
  inadequate for other canids.`
